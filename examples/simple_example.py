"""Play a game of hide and seek using Extremum Seeking (ES).

The game is played in 2D. It has a goal (orange) and a seeker (blue).
The goal moves randomly in small steps. In addition, its position on the
game board is completely randomized every 100 time steps.

The seeker is controlled by the ES algorithm. Its objective is to track
the goal as closely as possible. Its only feedback is the current
distance from the goal. This is a convex function, so ES is guaranteed
to solve the problem.
